It was pretty much self-defense.”</p><p>Tim Conway, a supervisor for the Pennsylvania Game Commission, said that most people who keep wild animals generally have two-section cages so they can isolate the animal while cleaning. For some reason, Kelly Ann Walz neglected to do this.</p><p>“Why this woman chose to go in the same area that the bear was in is beyond me. It’s a fatal mistake,” he said. “These things are not tame animals; they’re wild animals.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyxsdOsZK2gkal6rLXLpZydZaSdsqq%2BjKiup52iqHx0</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./dwight-paige-obituary.html><span>←</span><span>Sadly!
