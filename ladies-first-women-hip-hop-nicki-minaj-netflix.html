This disrespect to her legacy is exactly why Barbz go so hard. Nicki Minaj has had a longer and more successful career than any of these women ya’ll shown and has done more for MUSIC in general as well," someone else <a href=#>tweeted</a>.</p><p>"They’re literally tryna wipe her from the history books due to personal vendettas," another fan <a href=#>claimed on Twitter</a>.</p><p>"Yup, see, I look right over things pertaining [to] women in rap if they don’t include the GOAT," someone else <a href=#>tweeted</a>.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <span><a href=#>Lil Wayne Declares Nicki Minaj the Greatest Female Rapper of All Time</a></span></p><p>On the other hand, one fan tweeted that they're glad Minaj doesn't seem to be included because "she’s on a whole different level" anyway.</p><p>Yet another fan noted that Minaj is set to release a new album this year along with her own documentary.</p><p>"Nicki Minaj is dropping her 5th album PINK FRIDAY SOON with her own separate documentary. Y’all can’t wipe her from history when her impact is so humongous," they <a href=#>tweeted</a>, while another Barb <a href=#>asked fans to "be patient"</a> for Minaj to tell her own story.</p><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>Barrier-Breaking Women in Music</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6Wws8HSoWWcp51kuaKwyJ6qZp6Zp8C1edaopJ6mXZ22sXnHqKdmppmYuKp5zKKlmqJdo7K1ssuir2g%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./210100-html.html><span>←</span><span>Away in a Manger (CRADLE SONG)</span></a>
