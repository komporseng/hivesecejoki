Pool joined the Occupy Wall Street protestors on September 20, 2011, and soon after met Henry Ferry, a former realtor, and sales manager, with whom he created The Other 99, a media company. Pool also started live streaming the protests on his phone and immediately took on an on-camera role. While reporting on Occupy Wall Street, Pool used a live chat stream to reply to viewer questions. Pool also allowed his audience to direct where he shot the film. He converted a toy remote-controlled Parrot AR. Drone for aerial surveillance and customized software for live streaming into a DroneStream system.</p><p>Pool offered nonstop 21-hour coverage of Occupy Wall Street’s eviction from Zuccotti Park in mid-November 2011. Pool’s usage of live streaming footage and overhead drones during Occupy Wall Street events in 2011 prompted a Guardian piece to question whether such operations may be considered unproductive spying. A masked assailant approached him physically in January 2012. Following a conflict between Pool and Ferry, The Other 99 was also disbanded in January 2012. Pool also intended to webcast occupy protests across the United States for a documentary called Occumentary, but the project was never completed.</p><h2>How much does Tim Pool make per year?</h2><p>Tim Pool’s income per year is unknown</p><h2>What is Tim Pool’s net worth?</h2><p>Tim Pool’s net worth is estimated to be in the $5 million range.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmJa7orLUqGWcp51kwaq5jKmmqKRdmK6zscSrZJ6ZoqO2r7PSZpinnF2jsrV51qipraBf</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./susan-lucci-age-and-net-worth.html><span>←</span><span>Susan Lucci Age And Net Worth | Age, Height, Weight, Dating And More</span></a>
