Your mannerisms were all the same.’”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Asperger syndrome is now part of autism spectrum disorder.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Autism Speaks</a>, Asperger syndrome—or Asperger’s—was a diagnosis on the autism spectrum until 2013, when it was folded into the umbrella diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5.</p><p>The syndrome generally involves difficulty with social interactions, restricted interests, and a desire for sameness, according to the organization. Challenges for people with Asperger’s include hypersensitivity to sensory experiences, difficulty with conversation and nonverbal cues, clumsiness, anxiety, and depression. Strengths, meanwhile, include remarkable focus and persistence, aptitude for pattern recognition, and attention to detail.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGinaJyfmsBursilo2afkamytHnHmq2eZZGqwaq%2FzGg%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./sandra-cantu-murder-where-is-melissa-huckaby-now.html><span>←</span><span>Sandra Cantu Murder: Where Is Melissa Huckaby Now?</span></a>
