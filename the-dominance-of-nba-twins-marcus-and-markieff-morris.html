Both born in 1989&nbsp;in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, these two proud basketball behemoths are not just named athletes in the NBA but have weaved an unbreakable leash among them from their days on the Kansas hardwood.</p><h2>Early Days and College Ball</h2><p>While twins, the Morris brothers are only about seven minutes apart, but that small generated window seems to hold unlimited possibilities between these two who share a strong physical resemblance and an unbreakable bond both on and off the court. That journey to the NBA originated at the University of Kansas, where they played College ball and became an immediate sensation with their extraordinary talents which made them a fearsome partnership. Markieff, who was equally strong on the defensive end and defined a tough post presence, stood next to his more skilled forward brother Marcus in one of college basketball's elite frontcourts.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>NBA Career</h2><p>It was a lesson that began their unbelievable professional odyssey when they entered the NBA at the 2011 NBA Draft. Markieff was taken 13th overall by the Phoenix Suns and Marcus followed one pick later to the Houston Rockets. They have always shown off their talent with different teams in the league, with Markieff as one of the best defenders and Marcus as someone very good on both ends of the court.</p><p><br data-mce-fragment=1><strong>Career Statistics</strong><br data-mce-fragment=1><strong>Markieff Morris</strong><br data-mce-fragment=1>PPG: 10.3<br data-mce-fragment=1>RPG: 4.9<br data-mce-fragment=1>APG: 1.5</p><p><br data-mce-fragment=1><strong>Marcus Morris</strong><br data-mce-fragment=1>PPG: 12.0<br data-mce-fragment=1>RPG: 4.4<br data-mce-fragment=1>APG: 1.5</p><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>Both players showed their skills in the regular season as well as in playoffs, which will play a large part in helping of win their teams successfully. The sum of their points, rebounds, and assists account for a reason why they are feared players in the league.</p><h2>Life Beyond Basketball</h2><p>More than anything, the Morris twins have been known for their unbreakable bond on and off the court, as well as their devotion to supporting poverty-ridden&nbsp;areas. Their values, some not even basketball-related (Markieff being very involved in the charity Helping Hands For Single Moms and Marcus having just welcomed his son, Marcus Jr.), come from a different place.</p><h2>Unique Achievements</h2><p>The Morris bros. have carved out their place in the annals of NBA history for years, though — not just as part of twin-specific milestones such as being the first set to ever start for an NBA team, but as well the only case in recorded history of two sets of brothers playing on the same lineup at once. This success story is remarkable because, in general terms basketball and sports professionals, with equally good skills come in very few siblings.</p><p>To be sure, the story of Marcus and Markieff Morris is not simply one about unparalleled athleticism, but mutual success sustained by a steadfast bond between brothers. The path they took from the hard courts of Kansas to the bright lights of The Association is a tribute to their talent and commitment, but also serves as a long-term testament that there are few things on this planet as strong and lasting as brotherly love.</p><p>If nothing else, the Morris twins having reached the heights of an NBA can be seen as a symbol not only of their efficacy in playing basketball but also how they overcame it all as brothers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfqbWmecOopKKmkaOwpnnOn2SnmpFiwbi1zaxkppmimMK0ecCnm2alkae4qrHFn2Smp6KntrQ%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./maddie-hooper.html><span>←</span><span>Maddie Hooper</span></a>
