At first, Nihita averted the question; however, upon being repeatedly asked about the same thing, she denied having sexual intercourse with the old man. The query bewildered and annoyed Nihita’s family and relatives in Nepal. Nihita’s mother even talked about it in an interaction with a media person. She said,<br><p>I was shocked upon hearing the contestants’ question. We have a conservative society in Nepal. We didn’t expect such sensationalism or ignorance. Sobhraj is in prison whereas Nihita is not. How could the question of having sex with a prisoner arise?”</p></li></ul><ul><li>&nbsp;Nihita believes that her husband was wrongly convicted in the murder case of an American national in Nepal in 1975, a case for which Charles was apprehended in Nepal in 2004 and was eventually given a life sentence, and that there was no plausible evidence to prove him guilty. <img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Nihita-Biswas-along-with-her-mother-walking-out-of-the-Supreme-Court-of-Nepal-after-a-court-hearing-in-Sobhrajs-case.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-67846 class=wp-caption-text>Nihita Biswas, along with her mother, walking out of the Supreme Court of Nepal after a court hearing in Sobhraj’s case</p></li></ul><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=References></span>References<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul class=wpusm_ref_ol><li id=refid_1><a href=# class=jump_ref>1</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>Nihita Biswas’ official Facebook account</a></li><li id=refid_2><a href=# class=jump_ref>2</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>Nihita Biswas’s official Facebook account</a></li><li id=refid_3><a href=# class=jump_ref>3</a> ↑ <a href=# class=ref_address rel=nofollow>The Indian Express</a></li></ul><h3>Related posts:</h3><a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Abu Malik Wiki, Age, Wife, Family, Children, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Abu Malik Wiki, Age, Wife, Family, Children, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Rajini Chandy (Bigg Boss Malayalam 2) Wiki, Age, Husband, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Rajini Chandy (Bigg Boss Malayalam 2) Wiki, Age, Husband, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Varun Sandesh (Bigg Boss Telugu) Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Wife, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Varun Sandesh (Bigg Boss Telugu) Wiki, Age, Girlfriend, Wife, Family, Biography & More</span></a> <a class=yarpp-thumbnail rel=norewrite href=# title="Vithika Sheru (Bigg Boss Telugu) Wiki, Age, Husband, Family, Biography & More"><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-default><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bignamebio.com/wp-content/plugins/yet-another-related-posts-plugin/images/default.png alt="Default Thumbnail" data-pin-nopin=true style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><span class=yarpp-thumbnail-title>Vithika Sheru (Bigg Boss Telugu) Wiki, Age, Husband, Family, Biography & More</span></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamZy7ornEm6CoZpOkunC6yKGgrZldl7a0w8CsZg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./leo-robinton-age-height-wiki-bio-net-worth-what-is-known-about-emma-watsons-partner.html><span>←</span><span>Leo Robinton age, height, wiki, bio, net worth, what is known about Emma Watsons partner?</span></a>
