The media outlet reports that Griffth was laid to rest in a grave on his family’s property on the island.&nbsp;CNN spoke with a funeral home representative that handled Griffith’s arrangements. The funeral home stated that the late actor’s final wishes, including his resting place, were planned out some time ago. “This was the wish of his family,” the representative continued.</p><p>CNN also spoke with&nbsp;Larry F. Stegall, executive director of the state’s Funeral Directors Association. Stegall said that while the Griffith family’s actions were almost unheard of, the family’s wishes are always honored and respected. However, because his burial happened so quickly after Griffith’s death, it prohibited many loved ones from paying traditional post-death respects. Stegall commented that the arrangements were not the usual practice. He said, “I don’t recall having heard of it, and I’ve been here 32 years.”</p><p>A more common tradition would have been for Griffith to have been interred several days after his death, giving more time for anyone other than immediate family to visit him in-state and mourn with friends and family. Unfortunately, whatever reason Griffith had to have his death handled this way has not been released to the public.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnpJ2ybr7Emqqopl2uvLZ5wpqlrWWmnsCqwIyapZ2xXZy%2FqrLFoquhq12cv6LCxKygrZ1f</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./john-lennon.html><span>←</span><span>John Lennon</span></a>
