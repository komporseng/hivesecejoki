若くて才能溢れるMISIAさんもベテランの域に到達したということで時代を感じます。
MISIAさんは私生活にまつわる情報を公開しないので、わからない情報が多いです。
世間てにはMISIAさんのデビューした年や年齢を知れない人もたくさんいることでしょう。
また、知って驚く事実もたくさんあります。
MISIAの芸名の由来、実際はかなり背が低いこと、20年以上ずっとドレッドヘアーを続けていることなど・・・。
MISIAは何歳←実は43歳(2022年時点)。名前の由来や背の低さにびっくり！
芸名：MISIA（ミーシャ）
本名：伊藤美咲(いとうみさき)
生年月日：1978年7月7日
年齢：43歳(2021年12月現時点)
身長体重：153cm / 40kg
血液型：O型
出身地：長崎県対馬市（出生は福岡県福岡市）
学歴：香住ケ丘高校→西南学院大学商学部（中退）
家族構成：父親、母親、兄、姉、MISIAさんの5人。
好物：メロンパン
事務所：Rhythmedia
MISIAは身長153cmで体重40kg。背の低さを感じさせないステージでのオーラ ステージでは大きく見えるMISIAさんですが、実際の身長は日本人女性の平均を大きく下回る153センチです。
低身長でありながらも、あれだけの声量を、力強い歌声で届けることができるなんて驚きですね！
ちなみに浜崎あゆみさんやaikoさんも背が低いことで知られているので、日本の歌姫＝背が低いというのは１つのステータスになっています。
MISIAの芸名の由来は医者とアジア？本名の伊藤美咲とかける MISIA（ミーシャ）さんの本名は伊藤美咲さんです。
同名の女優さんが結婚したことで、一時期、情報が撹乱してMISIAさんも結婚してると勘違いした人もいましたよね。
「MISIA」というアーティスト名の由来は、「ASIAの方々にも音楽を届けたい」という想いから、本名の「みさき」とかけたと言われています。
そのほかにも名前の由来の説に、家族全員が医者であることから、医者との本名の「みさき」にかけてMISIAになったことも言われています。
MISIAは43歳の現在も結婚せずに独身。年齢を感じさせない理由？ MISIAさんの同期の歌姫の多くが、定期的に男性スキャンダルが出ています。
しかし、MISIAさんは芸能人の誰との熱愛報道が出るわけではなく、未だに独身であります。
ファン的には自分の幸せも追ってほしいと思っていることでしょうが、MISIAさんクラスになると何がその人の幸せなのか読めないので、「結婚すれば〜」とは言いたくないですよね。
MISIAは1998年にデビューした数々の歌姫の中でも別格の存在 MISIAさんがデビューした1998年は、国民的な歌姫が多くデビューした時期であります。
同期には宇多田ヒカル、椎名林檎、浜崎あゆみ、aikoがいます。
多くは全盛期や低迷期を乗り越え、波瀾万丈な歌手人生を歩んでいますが、MISIAさんだけはミステリアスな立ち位置から、コアな人気を守り続けています。
40歳を超えた後も、同期の多くが第一線で活躍されていますが、蓋を開けてみるとMISIAさんの音楽が一般的に知られ、受け入れられているようになってます。
キャララクター的にはメディアに媚びを売らないハンサムさんでありますが、そのおかげで長年男関係などの余計なスキャンダルとは無縁で、敵を作らない安全なキャリアをたどりました。
MISIAの髪型。なぜターバンを巻く？理由はアフリカやゴスベルへのリスペクト？ MISIAさんの髪型といえばドレッドヘアーと、”ターバン”ですね。
ドレッドに関してはゴスペルがMISIAさんのバッググランドにあることが理由のようです。
ターバンのヘビロテに関しては、単純におでこにコンプレックスがあることが大まかな理由のようです。
アフリカが
MISIAさんはデビュー当時からドレッドやターバンのスタイルを続けているので、20年以上は現在の髪型のスタイルを貫いてることになります。
MISIAのような髪型の洗い方とシャンプー 20年以上もドレッドヘアーを続けているMISIAさんですが、気になるのは頭の洗い方です。
調べてみると、ドレッドヘアーに憧れがあっても、手入れが大変だという理由でやめてしまう人が多いみたいです。
MISIAさんクラスになればマメに美容院で手入れされていると思われます。お金のあるドレッドの人は良いですね。
ちなみにシャンプーもオーガニック石鹸などお金をかけた方が良いみたいです。
家で手入れしてる人は週に数回、長い時間をかけて洗っているみたいですが、MISIAさんの場合はほぼ毎日美容院で洗って貰ってる可能性もありますね。
MISIAの素顔。すっぴんの方が可愛い？ MISIAさんといえば、派手な衣装にターバン、そして洗練されたメイクが印象的です。
若い頃は濃いメイクがメインだったMISIAさんですが、40歳を超えた辺りからナチュラルメイクが増えました。
メイクが薄いMISIAさんは印象がガラっと変わりますね。
派手な化粧をしてるときのMISIAさんはかっこいい系でありますが、ナチュラルになった途端、とても優しそうで母性的な印象になります。
歳を重ねてからの方が可愛いという声が多いのは、ナチュラルメイクが増えたせいかもしれませんね。
MISIAは現在の方が可愛い？母性が出て結婚疑惑も 若い頃のMISIAさんはかっこいい系のミステリアスなミュージシャンでありました。
しかし、歳を重ねるごとに表情が柔らかくなり、とても可愛い印象になりました。
歌う楽曲も儚い恋の歌ばかりではなく、家族愛や母性的な楽曲も増えていきました。
2017年に初めてバラエディ番組に出演すると、これまでのクールなイメージを払拭させました。
あまりにも母性的になったということで、MISIAさんに既婚者の疑惑が出たこともあったぐらいです。</description></item><item><title>Multiple MLB Players Donate Salaries in Honor of Jackie Robinson Day Celeb Secrets</title><link>/multiple-mlb-players-donate-salaries-in-honor-of-jackie-robinson-day.html</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/multiple-mlb-players-donate-salaries-in-honor-of-jackie-robinson-day.html</guid><description>On the 75th anniversary of legendary baseball player Jackie Robinson’s debut, when he broke the sport’s color barrier and diversified the game for all, multiple players will donate their salaries to a nonprofit.
