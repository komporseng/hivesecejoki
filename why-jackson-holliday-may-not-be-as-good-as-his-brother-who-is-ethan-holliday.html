Leslee Holliday's Instagram</p><p>As avid sports fans, we love getting caught up in next-generation potential superstars - especially when they have familiar last names. Enter the Holliday brothers, Jackson and Ethan. Though the name Jackson Holliday may be familiar to many baseball fans, you may want to get to know his younger brother, Ethan, instead as a rising star in the world of baseball.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Jackson Holliday&nbsp;</h2><p>We open though with Jackson Holliday. Born July 12, 2003, and since that time Jackson Holliday's venture into baseball became prevalent because his name was called as the&nbsp;1st overall selection of a Major League Baseball Draft in 2022. Yet his numbers this season do suggest that he is less likely to become as good&nbsp;his little brother.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Ethan Holliday: A Top Prospect</h2><p>The baseball world is buzzing about Stillwater, Oklahoma teen sensation Ethan Holliday. Ethan is one of the best high school players in his class for 2025 and has worked his way into a probable future 1-1 pick of the 2025 MLB Draft due to his outstanding on-field prowess. Being a member of a baseball family his dad Matt was a former big leaguer it's not surprising that Ethan is making his way.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Analyzing the Differences</h2><p>Playing Style: Both brothers are lefty infielders but they go about their craft differently. Wilson Jackson spends most of his time in centerfield, functioning most like his dad with the agility and great speed that display his natural talents, while his son Ethan is a power-type third baseman who just pops across the diamond two bags away.<br data-mce-fragment=1>Ethan's Power is Next Level: Ethan has put on a show at Stillwater High School in Oklahoma with his power at the plate, and it exceeds what Jackson can do based on high school stats alone. Doing so has made him the top prospect of his class and seemingly augurs well for the MLB.<br data-mce-fragment=1>As viewed from the industry: Industry insiders believe Ethan is much better than Jackson at a similar age and have talked up Ethan to achieve more than his older brother.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Future Outlook</h2><p>Will Ethan eclipse Jackson and achieve an equally successful MLB career? Though this is still up for one of the greatest debates, Ethan has the tools and potential to be even better than his brother on the diamond in college. While Ethan is still taking the high school baseball world by storm, the excitement of when he will ultimately make his pro debut looms.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>In the End</h2><p>Finally, without a doubt, the Holliday brothers have put themselves on the baseball map for all baseball enthusiasts across global. So while Jackson's relatively young career in baseball is still playing out, it's the fast track to No. 1 Prospect in the Class of 2025 that has folks dreaming and salivating with anticipation since it is Ethan's coming-of-age story that have him next. While both their careers continue to develop, the spotlight shines brightest on just how much Ethan may be able to outdo his older brother and make a lasting impact on baseball.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0mikpZpfrLW6ecmamqSrn6N6qbvLpaCdmaliuqLFjKemrWWSmnqiv4ygpqicXZbAbrTIrGSbqp%2Bptaa%2BjLCfqGWZqHqmwMeapWagn6G5qrDAsg%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-reason-you-cant-visit-andy-griffiths-gravesite.html><span>←</span><span>The Reason You Can't Visit Andy Griffith's Gravesite</span></a>
