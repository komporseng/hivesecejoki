She is <strong>34 years old</strong> and is under the zodiac sign, Pisces, She holds American nationality.</p><p>The name and information regarding Tabria’s parents are not available at the moment. Similarly, information about her other family members such as her siblings, cousins, maternal members, and any other paternal as well as other members are also not available until now. Tabria Majors barely talks about her family background and her upbringing in front of the limelight and the public. However, she has featured her parents in her social media posts and accounts.</p><p>Regarding Tabria’s educational background and qualifications, the name of the school and high school she went to is unknown as of now. And, after leaving high school, she attended the University of Memphis. Tabria graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor’s degree in music.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-106230 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tabria-Majors-Childhood.jpg alt="Tabria Majors" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-106230 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Tabria Majors’s childhood picture (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Tabria_Majors_8211_Career_and_Professional_Life>Tabria Majors – Career and Professional Life</span></h2><p>Tabria Majors was employed as a production assistant in Los Angeles after graduating from college. At that time, she had no intention of becoming a model. Likewise, she was active on social media and had garnered a small following. And, in the initial years, her posts and shares mostly involved herself, her friends, and her family. However, she was also concerned about her fitness and shared several photographs of herself doing yoga. Moreover, Tabria even regularly went to the gym.</p><p>A talent agency found Tabria Majors’s on Instagram and reached out to her in the year 2014. The agency offered her a chance to be part of “Sports Illustrated” magazine’s Swimsuit Issue. Tabria agreed and eventually was able to earn her place among the finalists for the job, beating out thousands of other competitors in the magazine’s first-ever open casting call. After that, Tabria decided to become a full-time model. And, she decided to quit her job as a production assistant.</p><p>Eventually, Tabria discovered that to be a successful professional model, she needed to invest a considerable amount of money in herself first. She had to maintain her looks, buy expensive make-up kits, pay for photoshoots, as well as even support herself in the early years of her modeling career. However, she could not hold a full-time job anymore and realized that she could earn some money working part-time. Subsequently, Tabria got a side job of cleaning floors and tables and was able to earn enough money to keep her dreams afloat. Moreover, in an interview with the “New York Post”, she revealed that whenever she told people that she worked as a maid to make ends meet, those people would look at her with disgust.</p><h4>More About Career</h4><p>Tabria Majors has worked with various international fashion brands, including Calvin Klein, Victoria’s Secret, and Fashion Nova in recent years. She also did modeling work for Forever 21’s website and was part of many of the magazine’s editorial photo shoots. Apart from modeling, she also serves as a co-host of an iTunes podcast, “The Thick”. Likewise, Tabria still rigorously works out to maintain the certain physique needed to be a plus-size model. Moreover, in an interview with “Health” magazine, she stated that she considers her legs to be her favorite part of her body. She also said that she is quite strong physically and her legs represent her strength, as well as her femininity as a woman. Tabria even plays racquetball. It is as if the sport helps her to be fit and healthy.</p><p>Furthermore, Tabria regards herself to be a sex-positive person. She also said in that same interview with “Health” that she embraces her sexuality a lot. She even believes that everyone should have the ability to convey it freely. Likewise, Tabria received some amount of criticism for her body. And, at the beginning of her career, the negative comments used to affect her, but then she learned how to ignore them completely.</p><h2><span id=Relationship_Status>Relationship Status</span></h2><p>Tabria is possibly <strong>single</strong> at the moment and seems to be more focused on her career, modeling, and life rather than being in a relationship. Or maybe she wants to keep her personal as well as love life as private and secret as possible and away from the limelight and the public eye. Even talking about Tabria’s past relationships, no information has come forward until now. So, we can pretty much assume that either Major has ever been in a relationship in the past. Or she has kept those relationships private as well.</p><h2><span id=Tabria_Majors_8211_Body_Measurements>Tabria Majors – Body Measurements</span></h2><p>Tabria has a <strong>height</strong> of 5 feet 10 inches and her weight is 98 Kg. Her other body measurements such as her chest size, waist size, as well as hip size are 44-38-55 inches respectively. Moreover, Tabria has black hair and dark brown eyes.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-106228 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/fresherpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Tabria-Majors-Body.jpg alt="Tabria Majors" width=650 height=650 data-sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-106228 class=wp-caption-text>Caption: Tabria Majors posing for a picture (Source: Instagram)</p><h2><span id=Social_Media>Social Media</span></h2><p>Tabria is pretty active on all of her social accounts.
