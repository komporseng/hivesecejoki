Maya was born in the month of April.&nbsp;Magalhaes commended Gabrielle (Gabi) for being somewhat calm despite the agony and contractions in his Instagram post presenting the birthing report from a paternal perspective.&nbsp;Gabi began having contractions at about 5 p.m. on March 30, 2022 and arrived at the hospital at 9 p.m.</p><p>When the doctor checked her, she was already 8 cm dilated. Gabi remained calm throughout the discomfort and contraction, which surprised them.&nbsp;She labored in the tub until she was 10 cm dilated.&nbsp;He observed how brave and courageous his wife was to deliver their daughter into the world without any interference or anesthetic when the water broke and they began the expulsive.&nbsp;He finished by noting that the total experience was unique and that they welcomed their daughter Maya into the wonderful world.</p><h2>She enjoys getting tattoos.</h2><p>Figueiredo enjoys getting tattoos. She has tattoos in various places on her body. “Love me more,” she has inscribed on her elbow. She has a Christian symbol above her elbow, a rose tattoo on her rib, another rose tattoo, a leaf tattoo on her palm, and “VIBES” inscribed above that. She has inscribed her birthday in Roman “XVII VII XCIX” on her neck, with the words “Light my fire” below.&nbsp;Aside from that, she has tattooed in other places.</p><h2>The career of her soon-to-be spouse Gabriel</h2><p>Gabriel was born in the Pirituba District of Sao Paulo and grew up as a Corinthians supporter, constantly witnessing a football match at the stadium before beginning his playing career with Avai at the age of 13.&nbsp;When he left home at 13 to play at Avai, which was around 521 kilometers away, he began to miss his family so much that he nearly gave up football, but thanks to God, he reconsidered playing and returned after two weeks.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Gabrielle-Figueiredo-2.jpg alt="Gabrielle Figueiredo" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Three years later, he made his professional debut against Gremio, a famous Brazilian club.&nbsp;He only stayed at Avai for a season before signing a four-and-a-half-year deal with Lille.&nbsp;He quickly impressed everyone with his ability and capabilities while at Lille, but he gained notoriety during his loan spells with Ligue 1 club Troyes, where he played under then head coach Marcelo Bielsa, and Croatian side Dinamo Zagreb.</p><p>Gabriel claims that he developed a lot during those years since so much occurred in his life in such a short amount of time.&nbsp;It was a time when he learned a lot, and it made a big difference in helping him become the player he is today.&nbsp;He signed a long-term deal with Arsenal in 2020.</p><h2>Net Worth</h2><p>Gabrielle’s net worth is being calculated. But we do know the net worth of her soon-to-be husband and Gabriel’s father. <strong>His net worth is believed to be approximately $25 million as of &nbsp;October&nbsp;2023.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Celebrity Fiance</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Gabrielle Figueiredo</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiempqinrKtuMRmnaKfpZq2s7HDqGSapJxirqO71K1kraCVYrOqrc2cnGanlmK0oq7RopylZZ2WtKK4x5qcrGc%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./ryan-minor-died-ex-sport-standout-at-the-university-of-oklahoma-succumbs-to-colon-cancer.html><span>←</span><span>Ryan Minor Died, Ex-Sport Standout at the University of Oklahoma, Succumbs to Colon Cancer</span></a>
