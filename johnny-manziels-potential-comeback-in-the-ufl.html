It will also determine the pluses and minuses, and the general feasibility of Johnny Manziel re-emerging in the UFL. Recent Fan Controlled Football League history cannot be complete without mentioning Johnny Manziel.</p><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>Who else thought watching Johnny Manziel play in the Fan Controlled Football League recently it just showed how much he still loves football. Manziel's performance, despite the league's peculiar set up, showed that he still has a passion for playing the game and it led to talks about him returning to a more standard football environment in the UFL.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Background of Johnny&nbsp;Football</h2><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>Johnny Manziel Known as: "Johnny Football" The former Heisman Trophy winner from 2012 was the most athletic player on the field for much of his college career, making highlight-reel plays in every game he played, making him one of the more electric prospects football has had in some time.</p><p>Manziel put up incredible numbers at Texas A&M and was the first freshman to ever win the Heisman Trophy. The leap to the pros proved difficult, thanks to a number of off-the-field problems, as well as an inability to translate his college dominance to the NFL.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Impact Johnny Manziel Would Have on the UFL</h2><p>The UFL figures to benefit greatly from Johnny Manziel being involved for a number of reasons:</p><ul><li>More Exposure: Manziel giving football another shot, even in a league down as the UFL, means big publicity for the league something that they could definitely use.</li><li>Growing the Viewer base: With the kind of flair Johnny Football brings to the field, the UFL could easily rope in a different breed of spectators, ultimately increasing viewership rates.</li></ul><p>What The UFL Gets: Well, the UFL would be getting some much-needed cachet from a polarizing player who, despite one of the more tumultuous NFL prospects in memory, has pre-existing experience at the highest level of football.<br data-mce-fragment=1>Merchandising and Sponsorship Opportunities: The UFL could benefit financially from Manziel and his popularity can open up merchandising and sponsorship opportunities for the UFL.</p><p><span>"If Johnny Manziel ever plays again, especially in a league like the UFL, prepare for pants-wetting of epic proportions." It also legitimizes Manziel's unparalleled abilities as a passer and runner with proof from key statistical data of his collegiate and professional career that supports his athletic impact for football.</span></p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Critical Assessment of Pros and Cons</h2><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>Advantages for the move back to the UFL would be plenty for Manziel, including avoiding the media attention and causing a distraction for his team and for the league to monitor his off the field antics. In addition, the reality of whether Manziel can even make it on a UFL roster depends on, if he is in shape, if he is serious about football and if he understands the UFL is a different animal.</p><h2>The Comeback</h2><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>So there it is: the possibility that Johnny Manziel might become the UFL's version of Gordie Howe and vice versa. Manziel would also be a huge get for the UFL, as his infectious personality on the field and skill set could further solidify the legitimacy of the league in the football community. Whether and how quickly Manziel could be reintegrated most of all depends upon Manziel's own state of readiness, with regard to the peculiar life of a free agent football player, and on a number of other developing factors on the organizational and personnel side of the UFL landscape.</p><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>With the UFL at a crossroads, bringing in a personality such as Johnny Manziel certainly could inject a very different kind of life into the football landscape.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miln6Rfn7ypus2yZKaZnq%2B2prjSZqeorJWjwaqty2aaqKWVl66kt4yipWasmJp6trLL</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./erik-asla.html><span>←</span><span>Erik Asla Celebrity Profile Hollywood Life</span></a>
