Albert Rutecki is one of the three main characters of the show, which is all about a group of three autistic friends living together and going through life together.</p><p>The show’s description of Amazon Prime Video says, “Finding love, making friends, getting a job, adulting. Watch as three roommates on the autism spectrum navigate their early 20s with all its joys, tears, and laughter.”</p><p>So, who is Albert Rutecki? And what character does he play on As We See It? Where is he from? Who is he married to? Is he on the autism spectrum? Find out the answers to all these questions below.</p><h3><strong>Is “As We Seet It” Actor Albert Rutecki In The Autism Spectrum?</strong></h3><p>Yes, Albert is on the autism spectrum. Albert himself has not talked much about his autism. Although at one point, he did say that he was very excited to portray his character on As We See It with authenticity.</p><p>Talking about As We See It, it is a new show on Amazon Prime Video about three autistic friends, Harrison, Violet, and Jack. And it seems this new show is ready to give actors on the autism spectrum their chance to tell their own stories with honesty.</p><p>Hollywood has a history of sidelining actors with disabilities. In recent years, however, different voices from different corners within and outside of Hollywood are forcing it to be more inclusive. Casting actors in the autism spectrum to play autistic characters might only be the first step towards that inclusion. But it is an important step.</p><p>The characters of Harrison, Jack, and Violet are played by Albert, Rick Glassman, and <a href=#>Sue Ann Pien</a> respectively. And all three actors identify themselves as being on the autism spectrum. The supporting cast of the show includes Sosie Bacon, Chris Pang, Joe Mantegna, and many more.</p><p>As We See It is created by Jason Katims, who is known for his shows dealing with sensitive topics like Parenthood, Friday Night Lives. Friday Night Lights won multiple awards including an Emmy.</p><p>The show will premiere on Prime Video on 21 January 2021.</p><h3><strong>Albert Rutecki Age</strong></h3><p>Reportedly, Albert Rutecki was born in 1993.

He studied drama at Hofstra University. So, he might have done some school theatre. He might have also done some out-of-school theatre. And in 2014, he worked as an extra in a web series called Aged Fruit.</p><p>However, when it comes to acting performance on TV or film, As We See It is first work.</p><p>Albert and Sue Ann also have connections with each other outside of the show.

In 2016, Albert posted a help post on Ellen DeGeneres’s Facebook page asking for some help.</p><p>We do not know if Ellen responded and got him some help or not.
