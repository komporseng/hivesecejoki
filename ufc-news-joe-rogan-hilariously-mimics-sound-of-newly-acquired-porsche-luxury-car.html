He is one of the most iconic commentators in UFC history, as his post-fight interviews are always iconic. He has made himself one of the most popular podcasters in the world. Rogan recently invited fellow podcaster <strong>Andrew Schulz</strong> and revealed his customized car to him.</p><p>Rogan spoke about his Gunther Werks GW-993 Porsche while on a “<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Rogan Experience</a>” episode with Schulz. He praised the car and said, “It’s a wild car, it is all air-cooled, and there is no sound deadening in it at all.” He then went on to quite accurately imitate the car’s sound. Rogan revealed that he sometimes just sits in his garage while admiring the beauty of his car.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>The car is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of its kind </a>and has Rogan’s name on a badge on the engine. It is a beautiful car with carbon fiber detailing. Rogan himself owns a huge car collection and is an automobile enthusiast. He has said that he enjoyed driving a car with a powerful engine and a manual transmission. Rogan also appreciated the craftsmanship and attention to detail that goes into restoring classic cars.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Rogan’s<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> car collection</a> was a testament to his passion for cars and his wealth. It also reflected his taste, as he owned some of the most iconic and sought-after cars in the world. There is no doubt Rogan will continue to follow his passion for buying cars.</p><p>Related:<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Joe Rogan goes off on Ford’s ‘very gay raptor’ truck in podcast episode and boasts having one in car collection</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-joe-rogan-talked-about-the-most-terrifying-video-he-had-seen><strong>Joe Rogan talked about the most terrifying video he had seen</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Joe-Rogan-talks-to-Sadhguru-about-his-trek-to-Mount-Kailash.jpg><p>Rogan has hosted various guests on his podcasts from many fields. He learns and shares knowledge and personal experiences with them. There have been many instances when Rogan has talked about very terrifying and eerie topics on his podcast.</p><p>In his most recent JRE Fight Companion, Rogan spoke about an incident that took place in Africa. He spoke about how two men going down a river in Congo on a kayak spotted a Crocodile. The reptile approached their kayak, flipped it over, and pulled one of the men into the water. He revealed that after the tension settled, only one man was in the river.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The nerve-wracking story told by Rogan shocked the guests, who were left intrigued.
