In March of 2006, the two were spotted kissing, and talk of their romance swirled. However, according to Hatcher, that public make out was the pair’s&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-lasso-id=266926>third and final date</a>. The star claims that Seacrest called her that night and simply said, “I don’t think I can do this with you.”</p><h3 id=h-jasmine-waltz-2009>Jasmine Waltz, 2009</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/upload.suggest.com/sg/uploads/2022/01/Seacrest_ShaynaTaylor-scaled-e1643145275878-1024x676.jpg><p data-injector-index=2>Seacrest began dating model, actress, and reality TV personality, Jasmine Waltz, in 2009. Though not much is known about their relationship or when it ended, the two were reportedly still “in contact” in 2014.</p><h3 id=h-julianne-hough-2010-2013><strong>Julianne Hough, 2010-2013</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/upload.suggest.com/sg/uploads/2022/01/RyanSeacrest_HilaryCruz-1024x696.png><p data-injector-index=1>One of Secreast’s most public relationships was with Julianne Hough, but sadly, it didn’t work out in the end. According to Hough, “There was nothing wrong or bad, but there was nothing right… I had one foot out because I didn’t want to get hurt. And I didn’t say what was on my mind because I didn’t want to ruffle any feathers. I needed to be perfect.”</p><p data-injector-index=2>Hough also cited Seacrest’s lavish lifestyle as a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-lasso-id=271361>reason for their split</a>. On an Instagram Live, Hough explained, “I was on private planes and yachts and living in a very, very well-off house — pretty different from where I grew up.” She went on to say, “I had just got out of that relationship because I wanted to create that for myself. I kind of felt like I didn’t deserve it. I didn’t earn that. So now I need to go create that for myself.”</p><h3 id=h-shayna-taylor-2013><strong>Shayna Taylor, 2013</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p data-injector-index=1>In 2013, Seacrest hopped from one long-term relationship to another. After his breakup with Hough, he promptly found himself in a new relationship with social media star and chef, Shayna Taylor. The two originally dated for one year from 2013-to 2014. However, this pair&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-lasso-id=272629>became notoriously on-again, off-again</a>.</p><p data-injector-index=2>In 2016, the duo gave their relationship another shot. They moved to New York City together in 2017, and they stayed together (for the most part) until February 2019. But, even though the couple claimed that things were really over, they still couldn’t quite quit each other. In 2019, Seacrest and Taylor walked the red carpet together at the New York City Ballet Fall Gala and seemed very much in love.</p><p data-injector-index=1>In May 2020, Seacrest made an uncharacteristically public display of affection on his show,&nbsp;Live! With Kelly and Ryan.&nbsp;“I just want to say, happy third anniversary to Shayna,” Seacrest announced. “It is our third time together. So we’ve gotten together, broken up, gotten together, broken up. This is No. 3 of being together. So we’re celebrating as well.”</p><p data-injector-index=2>According to Seacrest, ​​”It’s an eight-year run, but it’s our third run together.” He went on to say, “Listen, nothing’s perfect. You just keep trying until you get it right.” Despite this hopefulness that the third time would be the charm,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-lasso-id=272630>the couple split in May 2020</a>&nbsp;(for now, of course.)</p><h3 id=h-renee-blythewood-hall-march-2015><strong>Renée Blythewood Hall, March 2015</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p data-injector-index=1>Since Seacrest and his long-term on-again, off-again love had their fair share of “off-again” periods, the TV star had a few flings in the interim. According to&nbsp;People, Seacrest and model Reneé Hall&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-lasso-id=272631>went “on a few dates”</a>&nbsp;in 2015. The pair reportedly hit it off at Seacrest’s 40th birthday party. But, since this was during a breakup between Seacrest and Shayna Taylor, things with Hall didn’t progress further than that.</p><h3 id=h-hilary-cruz-june-2015><strong>Hilary Cruz, June 2015</strong></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p data-injector-index=2>In 2015, Seacrest met actor and Miss Teen USA 2007, Hilary Cruz. According to&nbsp;People, they&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-lasso-id=272632>met through mutual friends</a>. The pair took their romance slow and enjoyed some “low-key dinner dates.” However, the fun didn’t last for long, as Seacrest later got back together with Shayna Taylor.</p><h2>Who Is Ryan Seacrest Dating Currently?</h2><p data-injector-index=1>In 2022, Ryan Seacrest is currently in a relationship. But, in a move that’s not so out of the ordinary for men in Hollywood, Seacrest’s girlfriend is quite a bit younger than he is. Aubrey Paige Petcosky is a 24-year-old model. Ryan Seacrest is currently 47.</p><p data-injector-index=2>The couple was first spotted together during Memorial Day weekend of 2021. That same month, Petcosky posted a photo of her lounging at her famous beau’s pool on her now-private Instagram account.&nbsp;The pair has made great efforts to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-lasso-id=270891>keep their relationship private</a>&nbsp;from the media, but that doesn’t stop&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-lasso-id=272633>the rumor mill about them</a> from churning.</p><p data-injector-index=1>We’re rooting for Seacrest’s newest relationship to be the one that lasts. But, no matter what happens, here’s hoping that Seacrest will take his own great advice and keep trying until he gets it right!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8%2BepqmklWTEqbuMoqpmqqmWu26%2FxJqaq52jqcBuw8ifnGaho2K1pnnMmqmroZWZerOxy5qroqeeqLWqvIyhoKysn6fGcA%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./roisin-conaty-biography.html><span>←</span><span>Roisin Conaty Bio (Wiki)</span></a>
