Death Cause And Wiki Details</h1></header><section class=post-content><p><strong>As his wife, Carmen Sevilla, just passed away</strong>, learn more about Vicente Patuel’s Wikipedia and edad (age). Discover Carmen’s cause of death and much more. A terrible day for the entertainment, arts, and film sectors of Spain. Carmen Sevilla, Vicente Patuel’s esposa (wife), died at the age of 92 after spending eight years in a nursing facility.</p><p>She was sent to the Jiménez Dáz Foundation (Madrid) on Sunday, June 25, due to deteriorating health. One of our country’s most beloved ladies has died to make way for mythology. She was a superb actress and one of the greats, along with her friends Lola Flores, Rocio Jurado, and Shell Piquer, who were regarded as outstanding masterpieces of our folklore.&nbsp;In addition to being a singer and actor, she was well-liked as a presenter with her miniature sheep, “little coupon,” and distractions. The actress spent her last years isolated from everyone and everything, trapped in the agonizing and confusing world of memory loss.</p><h2>Vicente Patuel Wikipedia And Edad: When Carmen Sevilla Marido Did Died, How Old Was She?</h2><p>Vicente Patuel does not have his own Wikipedia page. His wife Carmen Sevilla, on the other hand, has a Wikipedia page that identifies Vicente as her second spouse.&nbsp;Patuel was born on May 4, 1931, in Madrid, Spain, to his parents. As a consequence, Carmen’s ex-husband was 69 years old when he died on April 24, 2000. Vicente was a businessman, although he was most known as Carmen Sevilla’s husband. After her divorce from her first husband, Augusto Alguero, in 1974, the pair married in 1985.</p><p>Carmen married Patuel 11 years after her divorce, but he, unfortunately, died after 15 years of marriage. The billionaire barred her from working and imprisoned her for over 20 years on a Badajoz farm.</p><p>“I had a lot of luck in love the second time,” Carmen said. Vicente was my life’s love, but I’m not going to blame Augustus for the first blunder. It helped me get through a difficult time when I separated up with Augustus.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vicente-Patuel-1.jpg alt="Vicente Patuel" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Patuel’s machismo made Carmen very upset as she knew he had no control over his future and that it was in the hands of others.</p><p>“I spent a long time alone and secluded in the field.” Can I withstand this? As he closed his eyes, he asked me. Is it possible for me to persevere?</p><h2>Vicente Patuel Esposa Wife: Carmen Sevilla Death And Obituary</h2><p>Carmen Sevilla, an actress, singer, and presenter of programs such as Cine de Barrio, died at the age of 92 after a long illness.&nbsp;Carmen Sevilla, one of Spain’s most well-known performers, singers, and presenters, died at the age of 92. Her death was confirmed by RTVE and Europa Press three days after she was hospitalized in severe condition.&nbsp;Because her death occurred just a few hours ago, the actress’ obituary has yet to be published on the internet. The actress’ family will want solitude as they grieve the death of a loved one.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Vicente-Patuel-2.jpg alt="Vicente Patuel" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>As they mourn her death, her family, friends, and community will find solace in their memories of her wonderful life.&nbsp;Carmen had a successful career as a singer and actor in Spanish films during the 1950s and 1970s before shifting to television in the 1990s and 2000s.&nbsp;Around this period, she also offered Telecoupon and local cinema. However, she has been at the facility since 2015 and has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s since 2009, with her health deteriorating.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiamqqdmrtuv8SvoKWkkWK8o7XTrpirsV2dvLh5w6KbZquYmnqltcRmm56ZpJ16pK3UrJxmmZ6Zeri1yqJknZ2klratv44%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-gee-whiz-by-bernadette-peters.html><span>←</span><span>The Meaning Behind The Song: Gee Whiz by Bernadette Peters</span></a>
