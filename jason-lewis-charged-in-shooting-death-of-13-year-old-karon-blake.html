Contee said the youths were peering into cars with flashlights and going into them.</p><p>Lewis is charged with firing first at Blake while he was sitting inside the stolen car. In the confusion from that first shot, Blake apparently ran straight at Lewis before he was fatally wounded, police said.</p><p>“The first shot was fired … at someone sitting in a vehicle who wasn’t an immediate threat,” Contee said Tuesday. Once the first shot went off, when Lewis was not under personal threat was, is “where things really unraveled” that led to Blake’s death, Contee said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Homicide detectives search for evidence and speak with residents on Quincy Street in Washington, D.C. on January 12, 2023, nearly one week after a district government employee fatally shot Karon Blake. <span class=credit>Associated Press</span></figure><p>“I don’t know if (Blake) knew that Mr. Lewis was standing where he was standing,” Contee said as he encouraged other teens with Blake that night to come forward.&nbsp;</p><p>Lewis was held without bail until a court appearance on Feb. 13.</p><p>With Post wires</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j2pmbGlfn660u81mo56vmah6pLTAq56enF2eu26%2Fx6imraGenHqlscCtn2anlmJ%2BdHnYnpirZZ%2BhsW63wKump2WSoa6ssY4%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./catalina-de-erauso.html><span>←</span><span>Catalina De Erauso, The Cross-Dressing Warrior Nun Of Spain</span></a>
