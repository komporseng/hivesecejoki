Tigger’s first choice may come as a surprise to some, though.</p><p>“My favorite, favorite, favorite one was Rap City Tha Bashment, it was me Elephant Man, Buju Banton with Bobby Konders playing the music and when I go to Jamaica now, they still talk about it,” Tigger said. “Cam’ron counting money, classic.

Ludacris is the only person to get the best of the booth three times.”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He continued: “I had to put Wayne in there because the world was excited about Wayne when he put the flag on there.

Big Tigger hosted the show for six years, from its inception in 1999 until he left in 2005. The show itself ended its run in 2008 but came back with two separate one-night-only returns in 2021 and 2022.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Elsewhere in his conversation with T-Pain, Big Tigger shared <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>an untold story about the late DMX that left the Florida native in stitches</a>. According to Tigger, X didn’t like him using the word “filmography” to describe his work and opted for the former Rap City host to use simpler words.</p><p>“I’ve never told this story before” he began. “DMX, we come back from commercial and on the screen is a scroll of all the films he’s in — his filmography. I was like, ‘Yo X, back on Rap City… You building a hell of a filmography.’</p><p>“X looks at me. ‘Ayo dawg, what the fuck is a filmography?’ I said, ‘All your movies!’ ‘Ahh, don’t get fancy with me. Just say I got a lot of dope movies, dawg.’ I will never forget that.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2021/07/Rapsody-Big-Tigger-250x142.jpeg alt="Former 'Rap City' Host Big Tigger & Rapsody Launch 'Off Top' Video Show With First Guest Conway The Machine" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Former 'Rap City' Host Big Tigger & Rapsody Launch 'Off Top' Video Show With First Guest Conway The Machine</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>July 21, 2021</p></a><p>Big Tigger’s anecdote had T-Pain roaring with laughter, with the Florida crooner replying: “That is fucking awesome, man.
