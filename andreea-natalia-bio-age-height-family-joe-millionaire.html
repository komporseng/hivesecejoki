She admitted that she is vegan and loves flowers and plants, that she is obsessed with traveling the world and culture. To this post on Instagram, Andreea’s costar from Joe Millionaire, Annie Jorgensen, was quick to drop in her comment that read “You’re so easy to love” and Andreea, hinting a friendship between them, fondly replied, “@anniejorgensen baby doll how could anyone not fall in love with YOU!”.</p><p>Yes, Annie, a former Miss Georgia, is exactly the one who fans believe to be Kurt’s frontrunner.</p><p>As for Andreea, she is on&nbsp;Joe Millionaire&nbsp;looking for a “real man”.</p><p>She knows love is not easy, but also has lived it enough to tell that it is always worth it. Last year, as Andreea spills, has been a crazy year full of so many adventures, friendships, growing pains, and love.

Ever since a five-year-old, Andreea knew that cooking was what she wanted to do. However, she ended up heading to school to become a doctor.

From the look of things, they have been helping her out in her dream of opening a cafe at Newport.</p><p>When talking in an interview about her cafe, the outrageous milkshakes to coffee, and pastries that it offered, Andreea described how her milkshakes are inspired by many different things such as memories or her family. So, in June 2018, she for the first time revealed that she has a 13-year-old sister. She said her sister is the one who inspired the “fruity pebbles” milkshakes other than the salted caramel and s’mores ones.</p><p>While that is all that she had told us people about her family, Andreea also has some stories from her early life.</p><p>On Instagram, Andreea sadly recalled her traumas as a child and said “Our trauma shapes who we are. It shapes how we react to certain situations. How we deal with rejection. How we love. And how we live.”</p><p>Putting on online indeed an innocent picture of herself as young, Andreea went on to say “<span>Often times I think about this sweet, innocent child. She was so eager to learn about the world, so fearless, so pure.” She said how she now wishes she could go back in time and hold her and t</span><span>ell her it will all be okay, wipe her tears away, ease her heartaches, and protect her from everything she was going to go through.</span></p><h3><strong>Related FAQs</strong></h3><ul><li><h4><strong>When Is Andreea Natalia Birthday?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>It is clear when exactly Andreea Natalia celebrates her birthday every year.</p><ul><li><h4><strong>Where Is Andreea Natalia From?</strong></h4></li></ul><p>Andreea Natalia is originally from Romania.
