For some reason I still don’t fully understand, it caught the attention of Good Morning America and they called wanting to air it the following morning! I remember feeling both a genuine excitement and a sense of gratitude that God would allow what we created to be highlighted that way.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Dude Perfect has afforded us some incredible opportunities that, earlier in my life, I could have only dreamt of. I never want to downplay the exciting pieces of this journey, but at the same time, each of these experiences comes and goes and their luster fades. It’s easy for me (and I think for all of us) to live for the next thing: the next tv show, the next concert, the next weekend, the next promotion, the next vacation.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>“Over the past year, God has been using a specific verse in my life to bring my focus to Him. Psalm 86:11 says, “Teach me Your way Lord, that I may rely on Your faithfulness; give me an undivided heart, that I may fear Your name.”&nbsp;</p><p>“No. I don’t want to burst anyone’s bubble or demotivate someone from seeking that next milestone, but just know that it won’t satisfy you the way you think it will. Think about it. Do you know anyone “at the top” who’s really satisfied with where they’re at in life? The richest and most famous people on the planet are some of the most unsatisfied people on earth.”</p><p><strong>Read more :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Zdeno Chara Net Worth 2022: Bio/wiki, Career, And How Much Money Has Zdeno Chara Made?</a></li><li><a href=#>Michael Blackson Liberian Actor And Comedian Net Worth, How Much Money Does Michael Blackson Make?</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX5i8pcWMo6annaNisbawxGannqqWmrC1ec2eq2avn6fBqXuSa2hxal8%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./trevor-st-john.html><span>←</span><span>Trevor St John Biography, Facts &amp;amp; Life Story</span></a>
