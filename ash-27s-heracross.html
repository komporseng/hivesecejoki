One of the Heracross followed <a href=# title="Ash Ketchum">Ash</a> and <a href=# title="Ash's friends">his friends</a> as they tried to figure out a solution to stop a territorial dispute between the Heracross and <a href=# title="Pinsir (Pokémon)">Pinsir</a>, which, unsurprisingly, came in the form of <a href=# title="Team Rocket trio">Team Rocket</a>. Team Rocket was stopped thanks to the Heracross and the Pinsir were able to return to their forest, leaving the <a href=# title="Butterfree (Pokémon)">Butterfree</a> and Heracross. However, the same Heracross was still intrigued by Ash and followed him out of the forest. Eventually, Ash saw him following and the Heracross happily allowed himself to be caught.</p><p>Heracross's battle debut came in <i><a href=# title=EP120>Roll On, Pokémon!</a></i>, where he battled one of <a href=# title=Rochelle>Rochelle</a>'s <a href=# title="Donphan (Pokémon)">Donphan</a>, easily outclassing it before the battle was interrupted. Although he lost a subsequent battle to her most experienced Donphan, Ash was satisfied that he had gained significant battle experience.</p><p>He scored a significant victory over <a href=# title=Nickname>Blade</a>, <a href=# title=Shingo>Shingo</a>'s <a href=# title="Scizor (Pokémon)">Scizor</a>, in <i><a href=# title=EP140>Wired for Battle!</a></i>. He initially had trouble with his <a href=# title="Leer (move)">Leer</a> attack being ineffective when Blade used <a href=# title="Quick Attack (move)">Quick Attack</a>. However, Heracross's reaction time of 0.18 gave him the advantage over Scizor's claws, and he soon learned to anticipate Blade's movements. Shingo abandoned his laptop analytics and began to order Blade's battle, where the two proved to be very powerful. However, Heracross managed to dodge Blade's Quick Attack, knocked it off balance when it attempted a <a href=# title="False Swipe (move)">False Swipe</a> and finished Blade off with <a href=# title="Horn Attack (move)">Horn Attack</a>.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/f/f8/Ash_Heracross_Gary_Magmar.png/330px-Ash_Heracross_Gary_Magmar.png decoding=async width=220 height=165 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Defeating Magmar with Megahorn<p>Heracross was sent to <a href=# title="Professor Oak (anime)">Professor Oak</a>'s lab in <i><a href=# title=EP146>Tricks of the Trade</a></i> in exchange for one of <a href=# title="Ash's Tauros">Ash's Tauros</a>. Ash later sent Tauros back in <i><a href=# title=EP147>The Fire-ing Squad</a></i>, and left Heracross in the Professor's care so he could study Heracross's behavior further.</p><p>Heracross made an appearance in <i><a href=# title=EP225>Bulbasaur...the Ambassador!</a></i> when <a href=# title="Ash's Bulbasaur">Bulbasaur</a> was sent to the lab. He was happy to see Bulbasaur's bulb, drinking the nectar it contained before being smacked away. He soon after helped Bulbasaur break up a fight between the Water and Grass Pokémon.</p><p>Ash had Heracross return to his team for his <a href=# title="Silver Conference">Silver Conference</a> match against <a href=# title=Rival>rival</a> <a href=# title="Gary Oak">Gary</a>. In <i><a href=# title=EP269>The Ties That Bind</a></i>, Ash sent him out to fight Gary's <a href=# title="Nidoqueen (Pokémon)">Nidoqueen</a>, but Gary quickly pulled Nidoqueen for his <a href=# title="Magmar (Pokémon)">Magmar</a>. Heracross fought Magmar regardless of the <a href=# title=Type>type</a> disadvantage, sending Magmar flying with Fury Attack. Magmar launched a three-pronged attack - <a href=# title="Fire Blast (move)">Fire Blast</a>, a point-blank <a href=# title="Flamethrower (move)">Flamethrower</a>, and its own body weight from the fall. However, Heracross overcame the flames by beating them away with his wings. He then broke through Magmar's defense with Megahorn, taking out the Spitfire Pokémon. However, <a href=# title="Gary's Blastoise">Blastoise</a> proved to be a harder challenge, firing a <a href=# title="Hydro Pump (move)">Hydro Pump</a> powerful enough to blow away Heracross's rock cover and take him out of the battle.</p><h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_the_Series:_Ruby_and_Sapphire_and_Pok.C3.A9mon_Chronicles></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_the_Series:_Ruby_and_Sapphire_and_Pokémon_Chronicles><i><a href=# title="Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire">Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire</a></i> and <a href=# title="Pokémon Chronicles">Pokémon Chronicles</a></span></h4><p>In <i><a href=# title=HS04>Showdown at the Oak Corral</a></i>, Heracross warned the other Pokémon about <a href=# title=Cassidy>Cassidy</a> and <a href=# title=Butch>Butch</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=AG133>The Right Place and the Right Mime</a></i>, Heracross met and shook hands with <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Grovyle">Grovyle</a> during Ash's brief return to <a href=# title="Pallet Town">Pallet Town</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=AG164>Ka Boom with a View!</a></i>, Ash used Heracross in the battle against <a href=# title=Spenser>Spenser</a>.

Heracross managed to knock aside the <a href=# title="Razor Leaf (move)">Razor Leaf</a> with Horn Attack before he was knocked back by a <a href=# title="Vine Whip (move)">Vine Whip</a>. The two Pokémon rammed into each other with Tackle, both proving to be extremely powerful physically.

Heracross was Ash's third and final Pokémon in the match and he was put up against <a href=# title="Nando's Kricketune">Kricketune</a>, and sent flying by <a href=# title="Silver Wind (move)">Silver Wind</a>. Kricketune then used <a href=# title="Sing (move)">Sing</a> to put Heracross to sleep. However, while asleep, he was able to dodge Kricketune's <a href=# title="Fury Cutter (move)">Fury Cutter</a> attack because of his newly learned <a href=# title="Sleep Talk (move)">Sleep Talk</a> attack, and combined his other new technique, <a href=# title="Focus Punch (move)">Focus Punch</a>. After Heracross woke up, he defeated Kricketune with a powerful Megahorn-Horn Attack combo, just before Kricketune attempted another Sing. After the battle, Heracross showed his affection towards Ash by suckling on his head.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=DP189>The Semi-Final Frontier!</a></i>, Heracross was the first Pokémon to battle <a href=# title="Tobias (Sinnoh)">Tobias</a> in the semifinals of the <a href=# title="Lily of the Valley Conference">Lily of the Valley Conference</a>.
