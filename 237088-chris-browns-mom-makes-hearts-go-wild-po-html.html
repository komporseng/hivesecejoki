While Brown made a name for himself and gained acclaim for his smooth-sailing music, his mom was right by his side, showing unwavering support and pride.</p><p class=Fg>In past times, Hawkins used to be plus-sized with a much rounder face, and she would often appear at events with her son or be seen in public going about her business. However, her social media engagements doubled up after she underwent a body and face <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2020/10/23/chris-brown-mom-before-and-after/>transformation</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/267dd53a4b56c8a48fa10be99acf916c.png><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>A fan's comment on Joyce Hawkins' recent photoshoot. | Photo: Instagram/mombreezyofficial</p><p class=Fg>One of the first photos she posted presented <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFfqB-xl60f/?utm_source=ig_embed&ig_mid=D5198A04-E906-4DBB-8254-738D37E1A546">a bombshell look</a> as she rocked her much slimmer face, full lips, and wild blonde curls. Although Hawkins did not hint at body transformation surgery, some fans speculated she had a facelift.</p><p class=Fg>It is safe to say that <a class="Xd a" href=#>Hawkins</a>, who loves to flaunt her beauty, has moved on from the trying times. Gone are the days when her Grammy-winning son was a subject of tabloids and dealt with several vices.</p><p class=Fg>During <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/2014/03/18/chris-brown-mother-court-jail-rehab/>one of those times</a>, Hawkins had not been able to hold back tears as she let loose her emotions in public. At the time, Brown was given a one month sentence due to his social misconduct. These days, the star singer is a lot calmer and enjoys his role as a dad.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtqcGhobXqktNGiqmaaoqTEr7%2BMpqamZZ2WuKa%2FjKGcmqqkqHqou4ywoKWcXaW8b7TTpqM%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./suzanne-marie-sevakis.html><span>←</span><span>Suzanne Marie Sevakis</span></a>
