are in one of the girl’s bedrooms for “girls time” as the topic about dating comes up ahead of an upcoming doctor’s appointment about a tumor on her breast.</p><p>She declared herself a “girl mom” before Addie corrects her to say she’s a “woman, not a girl.”</p><p>Leah then pressed Aleeah about her “crush” and asked if the tween is “missing your crush.”</p><p>Aleeah turned the tables on her mom and asks “what about your crushes?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

responded: “You do need to go on a date soon, you need to actually find someone nice.”</p><p>When Leah asked her daughter: “What would be the benefit of me dating?”</p><p>Aleeah said she would have someone help her “take out the trash.”</p><p>“Is that all the guys are good for?” Leah laughed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

the trash every week without a man’s help.</p><p>Leah explains she only wants to bring a “positive role model” into their lives and even if she starts dating, the girls might not meet the guy until they got serious.</p><p>“I’m Ok with being alone too, I’ve got you guys,” she added.</p><p>The clip then cuts away to Leah speaking to camera saying she does not “feel pressure to date.”</p><img

want to be physically, mentally 100% before I add anyone else to me life,” she explained.</p><p>She said she hopes she show them an “example of a healthy relationship” so they “can hopefully to do it differently to what I did.”</p><p>Leah was previously married to her twins Ali and Aleeah’s father, Corey Simms, 31, and her youngest child Addie’s father, Jeremy Calvert, 32.</p><p>Last month, the TV personality <a href=#>ruled out ever getting back together with either of her ex-husbands</a> but remains committed to co-parenting with them.</p><p>During a Q&A on her Instagram stories, fans asked her about dating and marriage – which she vowed never to do again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

Leah was very adamant in her response.</p><p>“This will NEVER happen!” Leah replied, before adding, “Jeremy is Adalynn’s dad, just as Corey is the twins’ dad.</p><p>“We all get along very well and put our daughter’s best interest first. I prefer to keep it that way.</p><p>“I will always wish them the best in life.”</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Teen Mom 2</a>&nbsp;star then told a fan she would “probably not” get married again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000620099958-1.jpg><p>She told another fan: “I’m open to dating, but I don’t think I’ll ever really get married ‘again.’</p><p>“I think it’s a lot of pressure on a relationship – for what? But who knows.</p><p>“I don’t really think this far into it.
