According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Sterling’s net worth is as high as $2 million, an amount earned through his successful broadcasting career.</p><h3>John Sterling Net Worth $2 Million</h3><p>John hails from Manhattan’s Upper East Side, growing up in the East 80s region. He is the son of Carl H.T, an advertising executive and Gladys Sloss. He went to Moravian College, but also attended Boston University and the Columbia University School of General Studies. However, he didn’t finish his education as he left university to join a small radio station in Wellsville, New York and pursue a career in radio.</p><p>His first job was as a play-by-play announcer for the Baltimore Bullets for the 1970-1971 NBA season He also assumed the role of play-by-play announcer for Morgan State University football games, serving in that position from 1971 until 1978, which only increased his net worth. To confirm that 1971 was quite prosperous for John, he started a talk show on WMCA, and then ventured further into sportscasting, as he became the radio voice for the WHA’s New York Raiders, WFL’s New York Stars, NHL’s New York Islanders, and New York/New Jersey Nets. Between 1975 and 1980, he was the announcer for the Nets and Islanders on WMCA, WVNJ, WOR-TV and SportsChannel New York. He then moved to Atlanta, where he hosted a sports call-in show on WSB radio, while also covering games of the Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Hawks, increasing further his net worth.</p><p>In 1989, John returned to New York City, and found a job at WABC Radio as the sportscaster for the New York Yankees. Ever since then he has worked for the Yankees, calling games on WABC, WFAN radio and the New York Yankees Radio Network. Throughout the years he worked with several colleagues, including Jay Johnstone, <a href=#>Michael Kay</a>, Joe Angle and Charley Steiner, while currently he is teamed up with Suzyn Waldman. John’s influence was passed on to television, starting the Yankeeography series, for which he received two Emmy Awards. He also started several other ventures regarding the Yankees franchise, which only increased John’s popularity and net worth as well.</p><p>Although a successful sportscaster, John has been quite heavily criticized by other sportscasters and baseball players for his inaccurate calls, however, he still persists and because of his inconsistencies, is one of the most notable people on both radio and television.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, John was married to Jennifer Sterling until 2008, when the couple divorced after 12 years of marriage. The two have four children together. John now resides in Edgewater, New Jersey. His home was destroyed in the fire in 2015, and he was one of many displaced residents.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=3.5714285714286><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$2 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 4, 1938</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.88 m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>92 kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Sportscaster</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Moravian College</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Spouse</td><td>Jennifer Sterling (m. ?–2008)</td></tr><tr readability=0.23529411764706><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://imdb.com/name/nm4644348</a></td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Yankeeography</td></tr></table><h3>Known for movies</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/networthpost.org/wp-content/themes/net-worth/images/celebrity_net_worth.png><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjqOmoaZdqMGmvsuipaBlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></section><nav class=post-nav><a class=prev href=./gervonta-davis-armoured-truck-ussv-rhino-gx.html><span>←</span><span>Gervonta Davis arrived for last fight in $300,000 armoured truck that weighs 10,000lbs</span></a>
