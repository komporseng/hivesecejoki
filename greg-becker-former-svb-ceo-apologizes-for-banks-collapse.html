The bank was responsive to regulator concerns about&nbsp;its risk management and working&nbsp;to address issues&nbsp;when&nbsp;an “unprecedented” bank run led to its failure,&nbsp;Becker wrote in prepared testimony published on Monday by the Senate Banking Committee.
“The takeover of SVB has been personally and professionally devastating, and I am truly sorry for how this has impacted SVB’s employees, clients and shareholders,” he said."><meta name=author content="Aldo Pusey"><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/app.css><link rel="preload stylesheet" as=style href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/css/an-old-hope.min.css><script defer src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/paper/js/highlight.min.js onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
